    <h2>Hello World!</h2>
    <h3>No silver bullet</h3>
    <p>
      I have always wanted to do things the "right" way. But I've come to see that there is no right way. For example, what folder structure do you use for your project. Group by type of file or group by code function. I've seen arguments ofor both, I've tried both. I've spent time on many projects deciding what to do. I think Dan Abramov's "move the files around until it feels right" is the truest approach.

      There is a problem however. Moving things around works well when I'm the only developer or when I'm working with a team who cares about the place that "feels" the most right to put files and likes to communicate a lot to stay on the same page. In practice, I've found that choosing a sub optimal file structure and sticking to it produces the best results in the long run. Otherwise a lot of will has to be exerted keeping things from becoming a mess. And team communication and decision making bandwidth is best used elsewhere.
